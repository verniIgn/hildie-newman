                    <p>I work with a wide range of issues including couples therapy for healing  relationships and individual therapy for depression, anxiety, grief, parenting support, and personal growth.</p>
                    <p>I often use Emotionally Focused Therapy with couples and families because I find it to be very successful in transforming relationships.  I use EMDR with individuals to help them work on changing limiting beliefs and healing the impact of traumatic events in their lives.</p>

                    <h2>Welcome to my Website!</h2>
                     <p>I am a licensed clinical social worker, (LCSW), and I maintain a private practice in Englewood, Colorado.  I specialize in couples, individuals, and family therapy.  I am passionate about helping people and especially love solving the puzzles of human relationships.  Although I am results-oriented, I have a gentle and compassionate style and can get playful with clients when appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Experience:  I have over 27 years experience as a therapist.  I graduated from the University of Denver specializing in clinical treatment and earned a Masters Degree in Social Work. My areas of expertise are couples therapy using EFT (see EFT page) and EMDR (see EMDR) page.</p>
                    <p>I worked in the Cherry Creek School District as a school social worker for 13 years. While there, I was instrumental in implementing programs that increased assets and resilience for children.  I wrote about and presented on these topics as well as on “Emotional Intelligence” to help parents improve their interactions with their children.  I also helped provide a Bully Proofing program in the district, was on the original committee which developed the program and presented on this topic at many local schools and on a national level.  In the schools I led groups for children of divorce and self-esteem building groups.</p>
                    <p>For 5 years, I led divorce workshops based on the work of Bruce Fisher and his book, “Rebuilding When Your Relationship Ends."  In that time, I helped almost 300 people make rapid progress in healing anger, grief and pain.  Research indicates that people make as much progress in a ten week group as they would have made in a year without the group.</p>
                    <p>Style: I am an interactive, solution-focused therapist.  I provide support and practical feedback to help clients effectively address personal life challenges.  I integrate complementary treatment methods and techniques to offer a personalized approach tailored to each client.  With compassion and understanding, I work with each person to help them build on their strengths and attain the personal growth they are committed to accomplishing.</p>
                    <p>Personal: I have three adult children and two wonderful grandchildren.  When not working, I enjoy walking, yoga, attending concerts and plays, reading and spending time with family and friends.</p>
                    <p>Education:  University of Denver,  Masters in Social Work</p>
                    <p>License:  CSW 989571</p>

                    <h2>Creating a "Safe Heaven" in Relationships</h2>
                    <p>Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is a relationship therapy that helps transform anger, resentment and distance to harmony, caring, and loving engagement; often in a limited number of sessions.  This therapy approach was formulated and refined over a period of more than twenty years by Dr. Susan Johnson of Ottawa, Canada and several of her colleagues.</p>
                    <p>The research on EFT has found that 70-73% of the couples receiving this counseling are successful in overcoming marital distress and almost 90% of couples improve to a large degree.  This is the highest success rate demonstrated by any couples’ counseling and it has been effective across lines of culture, race and class.</p>
                    <p>Human beings are hard-wired to connect with others and seek a loving and meaningful relationship. What often occurs, however, is that couples become trapped in patterns of behavior characterized by bickering and conflict.  This includes fighting about insignificant matters such as who takes out the garbage and how one squeezes the toothpaste as well as more significant issues such as sex and money. However, these issues are rarely the real source of people’s discontent.</p> 
                    <p>EFT helps couples deepen their relationships by uncovering core wants, desires, and needs and provides the skills for them to communicate these to each other in a safe and trusting manner.  Clients are able to get in touch with their primary feelings and emotions such as sadness, disappointment, hurt, and fear which are often masked by feelings of anger and frustration.  Couples learn how to comfort, reassure, and empathize with each other.  This is a key to building strong and healthy relationships and is the foundation for connection and intimacy.</p> 
                    <p>EFT is not a miracle process.  It requires that both partners be committed and motivated to make a relationship work.  It is not appropriate to use EFT for situations where ongoing affairs, abuse or substance addictions exist.</p>
                    <p class="sentence">The success rate I have experienced in my counseling practice mirrors the research results.  I have witnessed couples transform their relationships from being distressed to finding deep happiness together. It is exciting to see the positive changes my clients make after a few EFT sessions and I am hoping to help more people develop satisfying relationships.</p>
